# BlindChess

Description: Very much still a work in progress. Once finished this app should allow for the user to play chess blind. 

How to use: 1) Compile chess.py file. Make sure microphone and sound are turned on. 
            2) Use normal chess gridding (i.e. A4 to B2)
            3) Play chess normally. Board prints are availible in the terminal if you need them. 
            
Furture Updates: 1) Get speech working properly and consistently. Maybe pivot to military vernacular, instead of A4 you'd say Alpha 4. 
                 2) Integrate sounds for legal moves, non leagal moves, check, check-mate, gaining/losing pieces. 
                 3) Allow the game to show the currect gameboard on tap/click. 
                 4) Integrate AI for single player mode.
